## Artifact
### Grazioso Salvare Animal Application - Full Stack Web Application
This is a single-page application where users can view the animals in a database. It is currently a work in progress and additional functionality will be enabled later. The user will eventually be able to add, update, and delete animals via the website. The user must now use Postman (or a similar application) to add, update, or delete animals. Additional user interface designs, such as adding a picture to the animal card, will be implemented in the future. Commented-out code can be seen in the artifact in place of future additional functions.
