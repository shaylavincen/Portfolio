Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
I worked for Creative Technology Solutions and the client was "The Gaming Room". They wanted our help with bringing their game appliction, Draw it or Lose it, to more web platforms. They were only active on Andriod. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The easiest part for me was the first part where we had to summarise, recognize constraints, and evaluate the UVL diagram. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think the design document is good for organizing what the project is really about. It provided a wide veiw look at the solution needed. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would complete the evaluation of different operating platforms. I found it very difficult to find information for client side vs developer side. I also don't have a great grasp as to all the parts of each platform so I would have to look into that deeper. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Because I am a gamer myself I knew how important it is to make the game user friendly. If the client is not considered then the application will not be useful. A couple needs that I included were account details like a password. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would definetley use the beginning of the document to consider what the client needs and wants. The overview of the constraints and the path of development was very logically useful.
